you should be aware that date and times can be stored in many different ways.
One of the most common legacy methods for storing the date and time in online transactions systems is based on the offset from the epoch, 
which is January 1, 1970.
There's a lot of historical cruft around this, but it's not uncommon to see systems storing the date of a transaction in seconds or milliseconds since this date. 
So if you see large numbers where you expect to see date and time, you'll need to convert them to make much sense out of the data.

In Python, you can get the current time since the epoch using the time module.
You can then create a time stamp using the from time stamp function on the date time object. 
When we print this value out, we see that the year, month, day, and so forth are also printed out.

An explanation of some terminology and conventions is in order.

The epoch is the point where the time starts, and is platform dependent. For Unix, the epoch is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). 
To find out what the epoch is on a given platform, look at time.gmtime(0).

The term seconds since the epoch refers to the total number of elapsed seconds since the epoch, 
typically excluding leap seconds. Leap seconds are excluded from this total on all POSIX-compliant platforms.
